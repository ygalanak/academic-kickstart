My formal name is Ioannis and I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Economics at the University of Kent (UK), supervised by [Dr. Amanda Gosling]( https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/staff/profiles/amanda-gosling.html) and [Dr. Olena Nizalova]( https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/people/455/nizalova-olena). Also, I am a network research affiliate of the GLO, where I participate in the [VirtYS program](https://glabor.org/platform/virtual-young-scholars-glo-virtys/) of [2019/20](https://glabor.org/glo-virtual-young-scholars-program-glo-virtys-announcement-of-the-2019-20-glo-virtys-cohort/).

I obtained an undergraduate first class honours degree from the [Athens University of Economics and Business](www.aueb.gr) (graduated on the top 4% of my class). My [dissertation]( https://www.dept.aueb.gr/sites/default/files/undergrad_thesis_galanakis.pdf) graded as Excellent (10/10) offering me a scholarship to pursue my postgraduate studies at the same institution. Later, I received the Vice Chancellor`s Research Scholarship Award to complete my Ph.D. at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/) (UK). Since 2019, I work as a Teaching Associate (for the School of Economics and Finance) at [Queen Mary University of London](www.qmul.ac.uk/sef). 

Finally, I have worked as a Research Assistant to [Prof. Irma Clots-Figueras]( https://sites.google.com/site/irmaclots/), [Dr. Amrit Amirapu]( https://sites.google.com/site/amritamirapu/) and [Dr. Anthony Savagar](https://www.asavagar.com/home) on various projects. My support centres around data collection, management and visualisation.
