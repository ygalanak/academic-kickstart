abstract: This paper looks at the extent of labour market mismatch of public-sector female employees. It extends earlier findings for the British labour market taking into account the endogenous individual decision to work as public servants. Estimates are based on data from the British Household Panel Study and the Understanding Society covering the years 1991-2016. The public sector offers a few low-skilled jobs and employs mostly high-educated (female) workers. Regarding the market flows, private-sector female employees face a lower probability towards retirement. Quantitatively, the female outflow from the public- to private-sector equals the inflow from unemployment. Once comparing women to the median employee, the incidence of mismatch is unexpectedly high, with a noticeable difference after the crisis. Specifications using the selection model of the public sector on the employees illustrate a higher magnitude of mismatch. Pooled results seem to dominate when women seen in the male labour market or in a restricted subsample. Finally, the map of occupations in mismatch supports that the public sector is more attractive as a waiting room to a matched position for university graduates, since they queue less time.
