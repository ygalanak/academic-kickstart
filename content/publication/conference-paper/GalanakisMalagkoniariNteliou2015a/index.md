abstract: The quality’s tools and models are increasingly needed in education. This essay attempts to apply the combination of a basic quality tool, the Cause – Effect Diagram and a selfassessment quality model, the EFQM (European Foundation for Quality Management), in 21st High School of Athens addressing the issue of 'relations between teachers and students inside and outside the classroom.’ It represents a best practice approach and proves that students can contribute equally to the teaching procedure.
